# Reused components

The optional integration is compatible with the HyperspaceDB server and Python SDK. Upstream: https://github.com/YARlabs/hyperspace-db. The dependency is not copied into this repository.

The supported OpenAI Codex CLI is installed separately and uses its own authentication and distribution terms. Versioned JSON schemas under `astra_harness/protocol/` are generated from the Codex app-server command and are distributed under the upstream Apache-2.0 license: https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/LICENSE.

The optional Photon sidecar and its `spectrum-ts` SDK are external integrations. They are not copied into this repository.
